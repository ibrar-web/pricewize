## Why This Happened

### The robots.txt Issue
When you deployed to Vercel, the robots.txt file still had:
```
Host: http://localhost:3000
```

This told Google:
- "This is a local development site"
- "Don't index this"
- "The real sitemap is at localhost"

Google ignored your site because it thought it was development code.

### The Structured Data Issue
Without JSON-LD schemas, Google couldn't understand:
- What your business does
- What products you offer
- How your site is organized
- What questions you answer

This made it harder to rank.

## Key Takeaway

**Your website wasn't ranking because Google couldn't find it.**

The robots.txt file was telling Google to look at localhost instead of your production domain. Combined with missing structured data and weak metadata, Google had no reason to rank you.

**Now that we've fixed these issues, you're ready to rank.**
