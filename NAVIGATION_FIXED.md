# ✅ Navigation Fixed - Compare Page Now Accessible

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Compare Link Missing from Header
**Problem:** No "Compare" link in the navigation menu
**Solution:** Added Compare link to header navigation

### Issue 2: Get Started Button Not Working
**Problem:** "Get Started" button was just a button with no action
**Solution:** Changed to Link component that navigates to `/devices`
